~~WIP~~

Current: 
2x2 matrix keypad which uses timers to debounce input & capture repeated input. No keyboard functionality present. Uses a ESP32-WROOM-32 dev board.
I am using a 2600mah lithium ion battery to power the keypad.

Goals:
 - Setup bluetooth to wirelessly use the device.
 - Code the keypad to create keyboard output on button press.
 - Allow for programmable macros to be set.
 - Create a GUI to send firmware updates to the device & to configure macros.
      - Use .json file to store configurations.
      - Setup OTA firmware flashing to reprogram the device wirelessly.
 - 3D model a chassis to house the keypad & circuitry.
 - Power saving functionality (i.e. turn off or enter a low power state after no input for an extended period of time).
